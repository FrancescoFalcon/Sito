# Character Portraits

Place character illustrations for the Lord of the Mysteries Explorer here.

- **File naming**: Prefer using the character slug (e.g. `klein-moretti.webp`).
- **Supported formats**: `.webp`, `.png`, `.jpg`.
- After adding a file, update the `portrait` property for the character in the backend data or database to match the filename.
- The frontend gracefully falls back to initials if an image is missing.
